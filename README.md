# Leaflet.Marker.ColorFilter
A leaflet plugin that helps change the color of markers and some other filter properties.

This plugin is heavily ispired by [xtk93x/Leaflet.TileLayer.ColorFilter](https://github.com/xtk93x/Leaflet.TileLayer.ColorFilter) and [bbecquet/Leaflet.RotatedMarker](https://github.com/bbecquet/Leaflet.RotatedMarker)

I needed the same functionality with markers and this plugin was born.
